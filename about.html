                <h2>Why Advocate for Potable Water?</h2>
                <p>We all use water, don't we? Itâ€™s a crucial resource in our everyday lives. From drinking a glass of water in the morning to washing dishes, but most importantly, it keeps us alive. Access to clean potable water is one of the most important human needs. A safe, clean water supply is the backbone of an economy, yet it is greatly neglected.</p>

                <h2>Dangers of Unsafe Water</h2>
                <p>According to the Global Burden of Disease, unsafe water sources are significant risk factors in death. Lack of clean, safe water is one of the leading factors in infectious diseases. Cholera, diarrhea, and hepatitis A are just some of the diseases that can be contracted. Unsafe water also intensifies malnutrition, particularly child stunting.</p>

                <p>According to the UN, "In 2022, 2.2 billion people still lacked safely managed drinking water, including 703 million without a basic water service; 3.5 billion people lacked safely managed sanitation, including 1.5 billion without basic sanitation services; and 2 billion lacked a basic handwashing facility, including 653 million with no handwashing facility at all."</p>

                <h2>How Much of the World Has Access to Clean Water?</h2>
                <p>According to Our World in Data, almost three-quarters of the world has access to clean water sources. However, one in four people does not have access to a clean water source. The world has been slowly improving, but sadly, this may be too slow. In 2015, only 70% had a clean water source, but this has been steadily growing. However, if we continue at this rate, we may not be able to reach the goal of a clean water source for everyone by 2030.</p>

                <p>Governments should invest in research and development for cleaner water sources and sanitation. Generating awareness of this issue and converting it into action will further help us and our communities. You can also get involved in campaigns like World Water Day and World Toilet Day.</p>
