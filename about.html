                <h2>How much of the world has access to clean water?</h2>
                <p>According to our world in data, almost three-quarters of our world has access to clean water sourc. However, one in four people does not have access to a clean water source. The world has been slowly improving, but sadly this may be too slow. In 2015 only 70% had a clean water soruce but this has been steadily growing. However if we continue at this rate we may not be able to reach the goal of a clean water source for everyone by 2030</p>
